Ryan Kmonk IMM215, Spring 2023, Final Project: Interaction Assignment 

The purpose of this project is to create a VR meditation experience where the player can move around in a room and select between three buttons of which environment the player decides to go to. For example, when the player presses the ocean button, they go from the room to a beach with ocean ambience. The player spawns in a relaxing room and has a table in front with a choice of four buttons which are the four scenes. Then they have the option to choose any one of those buttons for their meditation experience. This project has been used with the Oculus Integration toolkit. 

As of now the options include:

	Rain
	Ocean
	Creek

I had plenty of difficulty crafting and coding this project, especially with VR development. I figured out the SceneChanger for the VR buttons but it's still a hassle to move and select the buttons without experiencing a bit of nausea and headaches which I hope to improve upon in the future. The design I think I did pretty well, just the functionality of the project proved to be extremely difficult in getting this finished.
